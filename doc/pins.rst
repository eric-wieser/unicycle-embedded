Pin assignments
---------------

The following is autogenerated from the source code. Pin numbers correspond
to those printed on the board. Within the code, these can be accessed with
``pins::TT_DIR``. These can be passed to functions like
:cpp:func:`io::timer_for` and :cpp:func:`io::oc_for` in order to convert them
into peripheral objects.
