Yaw-actuated unicycle - Embedded code
=====================================

This project makes use of [PlatformIO](http://platformio.org/) to compile, upload, and dependency-manage.

It is sufficient to [install PlatformIO core](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/installation.html).

The entire process looks something like this:

* Install python 2.7
* `pip2 install platformio --user`
* `platformio run` to compile the code
* `platformio run --target upload` to upload the code
